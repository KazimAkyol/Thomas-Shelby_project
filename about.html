        <h2>BIO</h2>
        <p>
          Thomas Michael Shelby is a fictional character and the
          protagonist of the British period crime drama Peaky Blinders. He is
          played by Irish actor Cillian Murphy, who has won two Irish Film &
          Television Awards and two National Television Awards for his portrayal
          of Shelby. The character has received critical acclaim. Director
          Steven Knight cast Murphy for the role of Tommy Shelby. The character
          is introduced as a First World War veteran from a family with Romani
          ancestry, whose criminal enterprise is centred in Birmingham. The
          narrative begins in 1919, and largely revolves around Shelby's romance
          with Grace Burgess and his conflict with Inspector Campbell. As the
          series progresses, Shelby's relationship with mob boss Alfie Solomons
          is a key element in many of the storylines.

          <h4>THOMAS MICHAEL SHELBY</h4>
          <p>
            Cillian Murphy had expressed an interest in doing more television roles, "Those iconic American shows had been on and we watched them and everyone was kind of conscious of that. I think the BBC were conscious of that and so I was keen to read some good scripts and they [Peaky Blinders] were the first TV scripts I got sent". Murphy admitted that he was not aware of who the Peaky Blinders were when he was initially presented with the script.

          <p>
            Peaky Blinders is a British period crime drama television series created by Steven Knight. Set in Birmingham, it follows the exploits of the Peaky Blinders crime gang in the direct aftermath of the First World War. The fictional gang is loosely based on a real urban youth gang who were active in the city from the 1880s to the 1920s.

            Netflix, under a deal with Weinstein Company and Endemol, acquired the rights to release the show in the United States and around the world. In January 2021, it was announced that the sixth series would be the final series. The last series was broadcast in 2022. A feature-length film set a few years after the end of the series is set to begin filming in September 2024 and will also be distributed by Netflix.
